## Semantic Simulation

### Modeling dynamic semantic distance via the evolution and aggergation of Semantic Structures 

There are two mechanisms which will influence the aggregation / dispersal of Semantic Structures :

 * association / disassociation links which exert forces on small scales and help rearranging the mutual positions of semantic structures which are close enough to each other
 * semantic energy field which is subjected to tiny local alterations based on past inferences produced by semantic structures passing through those semantic locations.

The goal of the simulation is to prove that the semantic distances between semantic structures do not contradict the prescribed meaning of the latter. Let me expound on the last statement. For this purpose I need to introduce few definitions:

**Definition**: _Semantic context_
The semantic structures in a given region of semantic space. The region does not need to be simply connected. In order a semantic structure $S$ to be **in** region $R$ of semantic space it needs to be enclosed by $R$ in its entirety - that is, there should be no substructure $S_1 \in S$ which is outside of $R$. 

**Definition**: _Prescribed Meaning_ of a set $\mathcal{R}$ of semantic structures
Let us consider a countable set of semantic structures $S_1,$ $S_2,$ $S_3,$ $...$ $,$ $S_k,$ $\dots$. Each structure $S_i$ is represented by its semantic signature $ssig\(S_i\)$.
